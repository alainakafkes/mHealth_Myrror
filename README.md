# Myrror #
### Harnessing tech to study & improve body image ###

**Note**: I pitched Myrror to students & professors of the [Health Aware Bits Lab](http://www.thehabitslab.com/) at the [Feinberg School of Medicine](http://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/) in early January, and my idea was among ten selected to be pursued for a two-month project. This repository holds all that myself & my teammates accomplished in that short period of time.

PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING. This aphorism is especially true for today's young adults, otherwise known as millennials. Inundated by images that promote thin and athletic body ideals in the media, both male and female American millennials are at risk of developing disordered eating or exercising habits. Young adults diagnosed with clinical eating or exercising conditions are already a common research subject, but little research has been done on preventing these conditions.

Introducing Myrror, the device that seeks to revolutionize the prevention of eating disorders and overexercising. Inspired by the [Reddit-famous "magic mirror" tutorials](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/magic-mirror/), Myrror features a two-way mirror affixed to an all-in-one computer monitor and a proximity sensor plus LED light. Myrror software relies on a simple black-and-white interface to allow the user to see their reflection in the two-way mirror while answering survey questions on a mobile phone. All user input from Myrror is stored in a Firebase database.

Since the non-disordered millennial body image has not been well studied, we intended Myrror to be a research tool that explores the effects of comparing one's reflected waist size to rectangular estimates on the screen. Though we have yet to carry out a full-fledged study, initial user reactions to Myrror can be seen in the video below.
